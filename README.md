The is the code from having worked through Harry Percival's excellent book on TDD.
https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/test-driven-development-with/9781491958698/ 
Its a simple Django app, but the book represents an informed and fun discussion of 'Outside-In' TDD, isolation, mocking,
Integrated vs Integration, etc ,etc, etc.... I would recommend this book to everyone interested in Python web development.
